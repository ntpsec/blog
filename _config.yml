  The blog for the NTPsec Project.
  NTPsec is a secure, hardened, and improved implementation of Network
  Time Protocol derived from NTP Classic, Dr. David Mills’s original.
  Our goal is to deliver code that can be used with confidence in
  deployments with the most stringent security, availability, and
  assurance requirements.
